Steps to build occult on windows
Install git: <https://git-scm.com/download/win>
Install mingw with codeblocks (its easier): <https://www.fosshub.com/Code-Blocks.html>
Click the `Code Blocks Windows 64 bit (with compiler)` option (should be the first one) 
Run & install it, etc.
Now copy this path `C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\MinGW\bin` and add it to `edit system environment variables` search that by the way
Should be right above `cancel` 
Now you have gcc and then you can run `build_windows.bat`
