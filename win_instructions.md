#Steps to build Occult on windows
Install git: <https://git-scm.com/download/win><br>
Install mingw with codeblocks (its easier): <https://www.fosshub.com/Code-Blocks.html><br>
Click the `Code Blocks Windows 64 bit (with compiler)` option (should be the first one) <br>
Run & install it<br>
Now copy this path `C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\MinGW\bin` and add it to `edit system environment variables` search that by the way<br>
Should be right above `cancel` <br>
Now you have gcc and then you can run `build_windows.bat`<br>
