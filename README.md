# About
A mysterious just-in-time compiled language... How about we read the grimoire to learn it? 
> [!NOTE]
> Occult is still being rewritten at this moment, the old branch has a working language. The version two changes are significant as it is a whole language rewrite and syntax overhaul. With that in mind there won't be much in the readme for awhile.
# Building
```
git clone https://github.com/occultlang/occult.git && chmod +x occult/build.sh && ./occult/build.sh
```
