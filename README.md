# About
A mysterious just-in-time compiled language... 
> [!NOTE]
> Occult is still being rewritten at this moment, the old branch has a working language. The version two changes are significant as it is a whole language rewrite and syntax overhaul. With that in mind there won't be much in the readme for awhile.
> [!IMPORTANT]
This project would also not be possible without generative artificial intelligence, helping me write, and learn along the way for this long proejct!
