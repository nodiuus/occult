<h1>The Occult Language</h1>
<p>
An enigmatic programming language, how about we read the grimoire to learn some spells?

# About
A mysterious just-in-time compiled language... 
> [!NOTE]
> Occult is still being rewritten at this moment the parser and lexer are done (i.e I have to do bug fixes in the future). It will compile into a custom bytecode format, then into respective machine code (e.g x86_64, Aarch64, RISCV etc.)

> [!IMPORTANT]
This project would also not be possible without generative artificial intelligence, helping me write, and learn along the way for this long project!
