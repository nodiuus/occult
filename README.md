# About
Occult is a Just-in-time compiled language, aiming to have blazingly fast compilation speeds.
> [!NOTE]
> Occult is still being rewritten at this moment, the old branch has a working language. The version two changes are significant as it is a whole language rewrite and syntax overhaul, so no code will be compatible as of this update.
# Building
```
git clone https://github.com/occultlang/occult.git && chmod +x occult/build.sh && ./occult/build.sh
```
