# About
An enigmatic stack based JIT programming language with a clean and modern syntax, targeted towards the masses.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of 11/7/24, the parser is still being finalized, and bugs are still being fixed. Code generation will be started relatively soon.

# Building
```
git clone https://github.com/occultlang/occult.git && chmod +x occult/build.sh && ./occult/build.sh
```

# Todo
- [ ] Parser complete
- [ ] For loops
- [ ] Arrays
- [x] Lexer complete
- [ ] Code generator 

# Crediting
[`parser::to_rpn`](https://github.com/occultlang/occult/blob/main/parser.cpp#L51) is based on [this](https://github.com/kamyu104/LintCode/blob/master/C%2B%2B/convert-expression-to-reverse-polish-notation.cpp) <br/><br/>
This project would also not be possible without generative artificial intelligence, helping me write, and learn along the way for this long project!
